# To-do list created with TypeScript using Snowpack

## Mini project to try out snowpack with typescript. Using snowpack it allowed me to replace bundlers to build my application which allows for speed up in development with live updates in the browser when file changes are made.

* Learnt how to create a snowpack application.  
* Used TypeScript to create a simple todo app.  
* Created custom Types to ensure only the correct data is passed.  
* Local storage used to presist the exisiting data.  

## How it works and looks  

### ToDo demo  

### Prerequisites  
* Computer with node installed.  

### Running it.  
1. Clone the project or download the files.   
2. To run the project, you can use your prefer code editor, and you should be able to run it. 
3. Before you run it, open the directory of the project in the terminal and enter: **npm i**. This will download all the node modules needed.  
4. In the terminal, enter **npm start**, snowpack will run and automatically open the app in the browser. *May need to accept a change in the localhost address, if there is a conflict.*
